# Identity Access Management (IAM)
IAM is a global service that allows us to manage users, groups, policies and roles. We can assign permissions to users or groups of users using Policies. Roles are policies that can be inherited by entities. They are necessary for services that run actions on our behalf (like EC2).

Wihin IAM, we can generate a Credential Report that lists the status of the credentials owned by the users in the account. We can also view the allowed services of any user with Access Advisor.
